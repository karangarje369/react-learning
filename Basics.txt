Things to keep in mind 1.State , 2.Rerendering , 3.Components

State- An state is the object that represents the current state of the app .
       It represents the dynamic things in your app (things that change)
       For ex. the counter in the react boilerplate

Rerendering- A state change triggers re-render  
             A re-render represents the actual DOM being manipulated when state changes

           
Components-


Virtual DOM - 


Rerendering Problem - 
  so if we add any state in the root component (main component / Parent) which is goona change after the render (wen loads) so the whole component gets re-render so to avoid that we declare the state that is changing in the nearest ancestors

memo
memo lets you skip re-rendering a component when its props are unchanged.

const MemoizedComponent = memo(SomeComponent, arePropsEqual?)
