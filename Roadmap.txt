Perfect bro 🔥 — let’s do this the right way.
You already know JavaScript, so we’ll make a 1-month React roadmap (basics → advanced) that’s structured, practical, and helps you start building real projects fast.

We’ll go week by week — you’ll learn, practice, and build. 💪

🗓️ 1-Month React Roadmap (Beginner → Advanced)
🧩 Week 1 — React Fundamentals

Goal: Understand how React works and build your first small apps.

🎯 Topics:

What is React & why it’s used

React setup using Vite

Folder structure (src, public)

Components (Function Components)

JSX syntax

Props & Reusable components

useState hook

Rendering lists (map)

Conditional rendering (&&, ternary)

Event handling (onClick, onChange)

🧠 Practice:

Counter app

Todo list (without backend)

Basic profile card component

📘 Resources:

React docs (react.dev/learn)

YouTube: Codevolution / Web Dev Simplified / Hitesh Choudhary React playlist

⚙️ Week 2 — State Management & Hooks

Goal: Manage data flow and understand React’s re-render logic.

🎯 Topics:

State vs Props deeply

useEffect hook (side effects)

Fetching data from API

Dependency array

Component lifecycle (mount, update, unmount)

useRef hook

useCallback & useMemo

React.memo

Controlled vs Uncontrolled components

Form handling

🧠 Practice:

Fetch random users using API

Build a todo app with “Add, Delete, Complete”

Stopwatch app (using useEffect)

🧭 Week 3 — Intermediate React Concepts

Goal: Build larger projects, manage multiple components efficiently.

🎯 Topics:

Component composition & lifting state up

Context API (global state)

Custom hooks

React Router (v6+)

Nested routes

useParams, useNavigate

Conditional rendering using routes

Code splitting (lazy loading, Suspense)

🧠 Practice:

Blog app (Home, About, Blog Details pages)

Theme switcher using Context API

Simple login form (no backend yet)

🚀 Week 4 — Advanced Concepts & Project

Goal: Learn professional concepts & deploy a full project.

🎯 Topics:

Performance optimization (memoization, lazy loading)

Folder structure for production apps

Environment variables

Error boundaries

Prop drilling & Context comparison

Intro to Redux Toolkit (global state alternative)

React Query (for data fetching)

Deploying React app (Vercel / Netlify)

🧠 Final Project:

“Full Todo App”

Backend: Node + Express + MongoDB (if you know backend already)

Frontend: React

Features:

Add / Delete / Update todos

Mark complete

Dark mode

User authentication (optional)

Deploy it on Vercel

🧠 Bonus (optional if time allows)

TypeScript with React

Testing with Jest + React Testing Library

React performance tools (Profiler, React DevTools)

React + Next.js (for server-side rendering)

🏁 Output after 1 month:

You’ll be able to:
✅ Build and deploy full React apps
✅ Work with APIs and hooks confidently
✅ Optimize re-renders and performance
✅ Be ready to learn Next.js or move into full-stack projects
